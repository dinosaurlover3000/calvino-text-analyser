# calvino-text-analyser
In Italo Calvino's novel, "If on a Winter's Night a Traveller", a character introduces her preferred method of reading - feeding the text into a program which outputs a list of each word contained alongside a number for how many times it appears, producing a count of each in ascending order of commonness. She argues such a list of a novel's vocabulary reveals everything the reader would need to know about its contents.

Many text editors, as well as those specific towards word count and analysis, are able to count the number of times each words appears in a body of text. This program aims to build on that functionality with the specific purpose of acting as the program described in the novel; it should output first, a list of the words contained and the number of times they appear in ascending order, then, novels with a known subject/theme could be fed into the program to further inform a model for predicting the contents of unknown texts based on their respective lists. Depending on acceptable accuracy, this could hold similar applications to tone detectors offered within applications like Grammarly.   

This project serves moreso as an creative exercise for the developer than to fufill a niche or unmet need for any sort of customer base; seeing as I cannot anticipate a function being associated that is more than a curiosity, not obselete, or not already offered through a separate application.
