# calvino-text-analyser
In Italo Calvino's novel, "If on a Winter's Night a Traveller", a character introduces her preferred method of readingâ€”feeding the text into a program which compiles a list of each word and how often it appears. She argues this "vocabulary measure" should reveal everything a reader might need to know about a novel/text.

Many text editors, like those geared towards word count and analysis, are able to count the number of times each words appears in a body of text. This program aims to build on that functionality with the specific goal of mimicking the program described in the novel; it should organize first, a list of the words contained and the number of times they appear, in ascending order. Novels with a known subject/theme could be fed into the program to inform a model for predicting the contents of new texts based on their respective lists. Depending on acceptable accuracy, this could hold similar applications to tone detectors offered within applications like Grammarly.   

This project serves moreso as an creative exercise than to fufill a niche or unmet need for any sort of customer base; seeing no function that is more than a curiosity, not obselete, nor offered through a separate application.
